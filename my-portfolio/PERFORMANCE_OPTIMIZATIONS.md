# 3D Model Performance Optimizations

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Excessive Console Logging**
- Eliminated all `console.log` statements that were running on every frame
- This was causing significant performance overhead

### 2. **Memoized Heavy Computations**
- Used `useMemo` for material creation to prevent recreation on every render
- Used `useMemo` for scene processing to avoid reprocessing the GLTF model
- Used `useCallback` for animation functions

### 3. **Optimized Texture Handling**
- Removed unnecessary texture cloning
- Added mobile device detection for reduced texture quality
- Optimized texture settings (mipmaps, filters, wrapping)
- Disabled mipmap generation on mobile devices

### 4. **Reduced Lighting Complexity**
- Reduced from 5+ lights to 3 lights
- Disabled shadows completely for better performance
- Simplified environment lighting preset
- Reduced light intensities and ranges

### 5. **Canvas Optimizations**
- Disabled antialiasing for better performance
- Reduced DPI settings from [1,2] to [1,1.5]
- Added performance configuration to allow frame rate drops
- Disabled shadows globally

### 6. **Geometry and Material Optimizations**
- Disabled shadow casting for most objects
- Reduced emissive intensities
- Simplified material properties
- Optimized UV coordinate manipulation (done once, not per frame)

### 7. **Animation Optimizations**
- Pre-calculated rotation values in radians
- Reduced floating animation frequency and amplitude
- Throttled scroll event handling with requestAnimationFrame

### 8. **Memory Management**
- Used React.memo for the main component
- Proper cleanup of event listeners
- Reduced object creation in render loops

### 9. **Loading State Management**
- Added loading spinner for better user experience
- Preloaded GLTF model
- Added timeout for loading state

### 10. **Mobile Optimizations**
- Device detection for mobile-specific optimizations
- Reduced texture quality on mobile devices
- Simplified lighting for mobile performance

## Performance Improvements Expected

- **Frame Rate**: Should see 20-40% improvement in FPS
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced memory allocation and garbage collection
- **Loading Time**: Better perceived performance with loading states
- **Mobile Performance**: Significantly improved on mobile devices
- **Scroll Performance**: Smoother scroll-based animations

## Monitoring Performance

A performance monitoring utility has been created in `src/utils/performance.js` that you can use to track:
- FPS monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Performance warnings

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Consider using a simpler 3D model** if performance is still an issue
2. **Implement Level of Detail (LOD)** for different screen sizes
3. **Use texture atlasing** to reduce draw calls
4. **Consider using instanced rendering** if you have multiple similar objects
5. **Implement frustum culling** for objects outside the camera view

## Testing

Test the optimizations on:
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Different screen sizes and resolutions
- Various hardware configurations

The optimizations should provide a much smoother experience across all devices.
